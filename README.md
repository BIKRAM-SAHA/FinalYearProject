# Learning Based Soccer Scouting System
This repo is strictly for use of maintianing and developing the Final Year Project seamlessly.

## Introduction
- will fill in later!

The project aims to develop a system which should recommend best players suited to play in a certain position in a given system/team. For this, the primary requirement is player data across a certain time period. We will be focusing on the Premier League (due to its global exposure and thus ease of getting the data required) during the ____ season.
 
Now, ultimately the aim is to increase the team’s performance and the data that we have are the stats for each player. So, we assume the labels for the attributes we have gathered as {x1, x2, …, xn}. And the final output should be an expectation/team performance score, something we can consider as a combination of xG scored (expected goals scored) and xG conceded (expected goals conceded). Since this is probabilistic in nature, logistic regression may play a part to some degree in the implementation phase. The challenge is mapping the player stats (the set of xi) to the team performance score effectively and accurately. A way to do this is by compartmentalising the problem in the following manner – for each player, assign a capability score (maybe using match ratings available on footballs apps and news sites) to each player based on their performance stats (the set of xi). A combination of the capability scores of the players selected would then provide a certain team score.
 
However, it should be noted that this is a context-sensitive problem, therefore we cannot afford to lose out on the context integral to a game like football, which is highly dependent on dynamics, chemistry and relationships. Also, just putting eleven players good on paper together and expecting them to do well is unreasonable. A famous example is Paris Saint-Germain. A relevant alternate case study would be Sven Mislintat, a well-known football scout whose methodology purportedly incorporated player data analytics and statistics, being hired at Arsenal in 2017 as the chief scout. However, the project was largely a failure, with the club going through a bleak spell largely devoid of major honours, with none of the players signed during his tenure presently at the club, and with Mislintat himself leaving the club in 2019. Additionally, the importance of formations, tactics and players having complementary abilities cannot be ignored. Manchester City’s treble-winning team came into being midway through the 2022-23 season when manager Pep Guardiola ditched his signature 4-3-3 with one inverted fullback joining the midfield when in possession (effectively a 3-4-3 while attacking) in favour of an unprecedented 3-2-4-1 formation in possession featuring no fullbacks/wingbacks and having three centre-backs and an additional ‘inverted centre-back’ tucking into a makeshift double pivot alongside the central defensive midfielder. 2022-23 turned out to be a dismal season for Liverpool considering their successes over the previous 5 years, as midfielder Jordan Henderson’s aging legs led to his inability to cover for right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold’s defensive frailties and tendency to leave space behind during his frequent overlapping forays along the right-wing, inviting much debate and casting doubt on the latter’s status as one of the league’s best fullbacks, despite his attacking output remaining among the best in the league for his position. Also, a very common observation is that wingbacks in a five-man defence generally perform better than those in a four-man defence due to having less defensive load and thus being able to contribute more freely to the attack, while the midfielders/forwards struggle in teams utilising a five-man defence as opposed to their counterparts utilising four defenders. The model that we seek to create for this project should ideally be receptive to such fine details and nuances and be able to reflect them to a certain degree in its findings.
 
One way to visualise a team is as a graph having a certain configuration (reflecting the formation/lineup) of eleven nodes (each node representing a player). The edges would be able to reflect the ‘influence’ each player has on the other, such as a strong influence from a goalkeeper to a centre-back in front of him (direct edge), a slightly weaker influence on the midfielder (indirect edge), very weak influence on the striker, etc. This graph would thus be able to reflect both the formation dependency and player dependency. Attention modelling and GNN may prove useful in calculating the ‘influential factors/scores’.

(example graph to be added by Bikram)
 
Ultimately the end result would likely resemble a simulator. We input our chosen formation and eleven starting players, remove one and ask the system to provide the best suitable fit for the vacant position. The system should return a list of player names alongside their likelihood for performing well in the chosen set-up alongside their teammates and other related statistics, thus functioning as an effective tool for player scouting.
 
 
 
It must also be noted that players are often signed based on factors such as injury record, languages known, feelings towards the club, its manager, players and fans, likelihood of settling in well at a new club and their psychological state and mentality. Obtaining the data for some of these attributes and preparing an equivalent numerical measure for the others to be used by the system becomes a challenge.
